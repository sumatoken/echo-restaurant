# Conversational Robot
An Inspring Conversational Robot.

We're trying to build a robot that can hold human conversations. 

Powered by Azure cognitive services and OpenAI.

## Current features:

- Listening for the wake word and only enabling cognitive activity when the wake word is detected. In our case the wake word is 'Hey Echo'.

- Transcribing the spoken command and generating a prompt to be sent to OpenAI.

- Playing the response on the speaker.
