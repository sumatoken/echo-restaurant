# Conversational Robot
An Inspring Conversational Robot to be installed in restaurants.

We're trying to build a robot that can hold human conversations with restaurant's clients. 

Powered by Azure cognitive services and OpenAI.

## Current features:

- Listening for the wake word and only enabling cognitive activity when the wake word is detected. In our case the wake word is 'Hey Echo'.

- Transcribing the spoken command and generating a prompt to be sent to OpenAI (gpt-3.5-turbo).

- Getting the menu of the restaurants.

- Placing orders.

- Playing the response on the speaker.
